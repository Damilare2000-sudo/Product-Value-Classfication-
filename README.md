I use the LEFT JOIN statement to connect multiple tables wiht a foreign key, and assing aliases to each column from each table as I write the query. 
I then use a CASE WHEN stetment to assign HIGH or LOW conditions to various orders wrapping it up by using the WHERE statement to select only orders from a certain date.
